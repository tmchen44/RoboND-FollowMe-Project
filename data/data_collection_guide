"h" to switch local control and patrol mode

Three aspects of control in data collection process:
1. Path that quad will take while on patrol (not the same as follow mode)
2. Path that hero will walk
3. Locations of other people spawns

Setting Patrol Points for quad:
- Start in local control mode by toggling "h"
- Press "p" to set starting patrol point (in green, at quad's current position)
- Move quad and press "p" again to add another patrol point
- Now when you press "h" quad will start patrol mode
- Press "l" to remove all patrol points

Setting hero path:
- Start in local control mode
- Press "o" to set path point, sets at current quad position
- remove all hero path points by pressing "k"
- hero will start at first path point and walk around path. At end, hero will disappear and appear again at beginning of path

Setting spawn points for other people:
- set spawn point at current quad x, y position by pressing "i"
- remove all spawn points with "j"
- might be helpful to rotate camera to view quad from directly above

May want multiple collection runs targeting specific types of data (environment, other people, hero):
- Will probably want to have a large sample of data containing the hero
- If you create a large patrol path and hero path, you will probably not get many images of the hero.
- can create folders like "target", "non-targets", "environment"

Starting collection run:
- Once patrol path, hero path, and spawn points are set, press "m" to have people start spawning.
- press "r" to start recording.
- Recommended that you restart the sim (using "esc") before trying to set up another data collection run.
- Press "h" to have quad enter patrol mode. Press "9" to speed up data collection process.
- when done collecting data, press "r" to stop recording.

Best practices:
- use "j, k, l" to clear all waypoints
- try to get all angles of hero using patrol. gather data while in patrol directly over the hero, as she zigzags
- standard patrol data (without hero?)
- follow hero in a dense crowd
